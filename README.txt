Project Title: Movie Genre Classification

Introduction

Brief Overview: Clearly state the purpose of the project, which is to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
Motivation: Explain why this project is valuable or interesting. For instance, it could help with movie recommendations, content categorization, or understanding genre trends.
Objective: Define the specific goal of the project, such as achieving a certain accuracy level or identifying the most effective machine learning techniques for this task.
Dataset

Description: Provide details about the dataset used, including its source, size, and format. If it's a custom dataset, explain how it was collected or created.
Preprocessing: Describe any preprocessing steps applied to the data, such as cleaning, tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization.
Methodology

Feature Engineering: Explain how textual features were extracted from the plot summaries. This might involve techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Machine Learning Models: List the machine learning algorithms employed for classification (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines).
Model Training and Evaluation: Describe the process of training the models on the preprocessed data and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Hyperparameter Tuning: If applicable, mention the hyperparameter tuning techniques used to optimize model performance.
